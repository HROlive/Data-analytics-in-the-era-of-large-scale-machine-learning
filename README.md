## Description

This event was part of the EuroCC2 project and the National Competence Center activities, in collaboration with the Greek National Competence Center, and it provided training on the following subjects:

- Large-scale generative models for language and vision (including LLMs): How they work – and what we still do not know about them
- PyTorch Neural Networks: Running on CPUs and GPUs
- Streamlined Data Analysis with NBML: Harnessing AI Algorithms for Predictive Modelling
- Efficient Data Cleaning and Pre-processing Techniques for Robust Machine Learning
- GPU CUDA Programming

# Data analytics in the era of large-scale machine learning
Training event of [EuroCC
Cyprus](https://eurocc.cyi.ac.cy),
May 23rd & 24th, 2023

This event is part of the EuroCC2 project and the National Competence
Center activities, in collaboration with the Greek National Competence
Center. More details [here](https://eurocc.cyi.ac.cy/data-analytics-in-the-era-of-large-scale-machine-learning/).

### Pre-requisites
For following the hands-on practicals of the "GPU CUDA Programming"
session, attendees should be familiar with programming in C/C++

### Requirements
All attendees will need to bring a laptop or tablet with the
following:

- A web browser
- A PDF viewer
- An ssh client, e.g. a terminal for Mac or Linux, or Windows with
  [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or
  [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org) (for the "GPU CUDA Programming"
  session)
- The ability to edit text files on a remote server. E.g. via
  text-based Emacs or Vim, or via the [VS Code Remote -
  SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension or
  similar (for the "GPU CUDA Programming" session)
